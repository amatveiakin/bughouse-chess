# Bughouse chess platform

**This is the backend behind [bughouse.pro](https://bughouse.pro).**

It implements a client and a server for
[bughouse chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bughouse_chess) — the
best<sup>[citation not needed]</sup> kind of chess.

It exists because alternative bughouse implementations use a fixed set of rules
while the rules in fact vary.

Supported rule variations:

- Starting position: classic or Fischer random (a.k.a. Chess960).
- Limits on where pawns can be dropped.
- Limits on drop aggression, e.g. cannot drop piece if that leads to checkmate.

Folder structure:

- `/` — The core library (`bughouse_chess` Rust package).
- `/bughouse_console` — A binary that can run as a server or as console client.
  Note that this is only a game engine server. It does not serve HTML content.
- `/bughouse_wasm` — WASM (WebAssembly) bindings for the web client.
- `/bughouse_webserver` — Dynamic HTML content server.
- `/www` — Web client based on the abovementioned WASM bindings.


## Docker setup

Build the container:

```
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t bughouse-chess .
```

Run the container:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p14361:14361 -p 14362:14362 bughouse-chess
```

Go to http://localhost:8080 for the game and to http://localhost:14362/dyn/stats
or http://localhost:14362/dyn/games for stats.

> **Note** Docker is the easiest way to set up the entire environment. It's
> configured to make `docker build` / `docker run` development workflow somewhat
> non-miserable (Cargo caches are kept and changes to things like HTML don't
> trigger Rust builds at all). Still, [Local setup](#local-setup) below provides
> way better speed and flexibility: you can keep the server running while
> relaunching the client; update HTML, CSS and JS on the fly; or keep game
> history across launches in a local SQLite DB.


## Local setup

Run once:

```
cd www && npm install
```

Build & run game engine server and webserver (in two separate terminals):

```
cargo run --package bughouse_console -- server --sqlite-db ~/bughouse.db
cargo run --package bughouse_webserver --sqlite-db ~/bughouse.db
```

Running the webserver is optional. It is only used to display game statistics
and it's not required for the game itself. If you don't run the webserver,
`--sqlite-db` can also be omitted.

Run once in the beginning and every time after changing Rust code:

```
cd bughouse_wasm && wasm-pack build
```

Serve web client locally:

```
cd www && npm run start
```

Go to http://localhost:8080/. The client would automatically connect to the
local server. If the webserver is running, the stats are at
http://localhost:14362/dyn/stats and http://localhost:14362/dyn/games.

Changes to CSS will apply immediately. Changes to HTML and JS will
apply after a page refresh. Changes to Rust code must be recompiled via
`wasm-pack` (see above).


## Full Apache-based server setup

Serve static content:

```
cd bughouse_wasm && wasm-pack build && cd ../www && npm run build
sudo cp dist/* /var/www/<site>
```

Install Apache modules:

```
sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http proxy_wstunnel headers deflate
```

Configure Apache:
- Enable request redirection to make game server and statistics server available
- (Optional) Set `Cache-Control` to `no-cache` to make sure that the clients are
  always up-to-date.
- (Optional) Enable GZIP compression.

Add this to `/etc/apache2/sites-available/<site>`:

```
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPass /dyn http://localhost:14362/dyn
    ProxyPassReverse /dyn http://localhost:14362/dyn
    ProxyPass /ws ws://localhost:14361 keepalive=On
    ProxyPassReverse /ws ws://localhost:14361

    Header Set Cache-Control "no-cache"

    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/wasm
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/opentype
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/otf
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/ttf
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/woff
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/woff2
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE image/svg+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/javascript
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
</VirtualHost>
```

Run the engine server:

```
export RUST_BACKTRACE=1
export RUST_LOG=INFO
cargo run -r --package bughouse_console -- server --sqlite-db <DB>
```

Run the webserver:

```
export RUST_BACKTRACE=1
export RUST_LOG=INFO
cargo run -r --package bughouse_webserver -- --database-address <DB>
```


## Local console client setup

> **Warning**
> Console client hasn't been updated to the latest protocol version and is
> currently broken.

Build & run server:

```
cargo run --package bughouse_console -- server
```

Build & run client:

```
cargo run --package bughouse_console -- client <server_address> <contest_id> <player_name>
```

Note. Client requires a modern terminal with raw mode support.
Windows 10+ cmd and most Linux terminals should work, while mingw, git bash,
cmd and powershell in older Windows versions may not.

Note. Unicode support in Windows cmd built-in fonts is very poor. You need to
install and activate custom fonts (e.g. DejaVu Sans Mono) in order for chess
pieces to render properly in Windows terminal.
